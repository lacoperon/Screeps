###@lacoperon's Screeps code!

####What is Screeps?

Screeps is an MMO sandbox game, in which programmers develop their own units' AI,
using syntactically correct Javascript (or in my case, Typescript, as it is a
superset of Javascript with static typing, classes, interfaces and modules).

I thought I'd give it a whirl. I'm using **TravisCI** to continually test my code,
as well as **grunt** to compile my code, and deploy it to the Screeps servers.

I'd really encourage you to read up on how Screeps actually runs each player's code
in a different context; it's very cool.
